## General Information
- U.S. based bike company boombikes which makes bikes available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free wants to predict demand of their bikes.
- They want to know which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bike.
- They also want toknow how well these variables describe the bike demands.


<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Bike demands depends on various features like year, humidity, month, weather, holiday and etc.
- The top three driving factors are feeling temperature, humidity and year,
